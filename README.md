**Description**\
Object catching game written in JS using p5js library as a test project to have fun with the p5js. It is supposed to be educational - 
to teach to which rubbish bins goes each type of rubbish. Currently it is only in Polish language. 

All assets done by myself using Figma.

Quick instructions on how to play are available in-game.

*Note:*
It was rather a scratch project and thus it does not support any kind of responsivness - canvas size hardcoded at 1152x1024. However
it targets desktop devices and with this size it should be playable on most modern devices.
